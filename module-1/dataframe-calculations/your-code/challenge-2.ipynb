    "In this challenge we will continue working with the `Pokemon` dataset. We will attempt solving a slightly more complex problem in which we will practice the iterative data analysis process you leaned in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOomNicqbkk).\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem statement is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**You are at a Pokemon black market planning to buy a Pokemon for battle. All Pokemon are sold at the same price and you can only afford to buy one. You cannot choose which specific Pokemon to buy. However, you can specify the type of the Pokemon - one type that exists in either `Type 1` or `Type 2`. Which type should you choose in order to maximize your chance of receiving a good Pokemon?**\n",

    "Now that we have consolidated the abilities fields, we can update the problem statement. The new problem statement is:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which pokemon type is most likely to have the highest `Total` value?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the updated problem statement, we assume there is a certain relationship between the `Total` and the pokemon type. But we have two *type* fields (`Type 1` and `Type 2`) that have string values. In data analysis, string fields have to be transformed to numerical format in order to be analyzed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, keep in mind that `Type 1` always has a value but `Type 2` is sometimes empty (having the `NaN` value). Also, the pokemon type we choose may be either in `Type 1` or `Type 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now our expectation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Type 1` and `Type 2` string variables need to be converted to numerical variables in order to identify the relationship between `Total` and the pokemon type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The information we need to collect is:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to convert two string variables to numerical?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's address the first question first. You can use a method called **One Hot Encoding** which is frequently used in machine learning to encode categorical string variables to numerical. The idea is to gather all the possible string values in a categorical field and create a numerical field for each unique string value. Each of those numerical fields uses `1` and `0` to indicate whether the data record has the corresponding categorical value. A detailed explanation of One Hot Encoding can be found in [this article](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-one-hot-encoding-why-and-when-do-you-have-to-use-it-e3c6186d008f). You will formally learn it in Module 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if a pokemon has `Type 1` as `Poison` and `Type 2` as `Fire`, then its `Poison` and `Fire` fields are `1` whereas all other fields are `0`. If a pokemon has `Type 1` as `Water` and `Type 2` as `NaN`, then its `Water` field is `1` whereas all other fields are `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In the next cell, use One Hot Encoding to encode `Type 1` and `Type 2`. Use the pokemon type values as the names of the numerical fields you create.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new numerical variables you create should look like below:\n",
